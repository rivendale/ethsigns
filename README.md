Ethereum - Chinese Zodiac - favorite projects - Medium journal log: https://resourcehub.medium.com/ethereum-turn-based-strategy-game-and-nfts-working-draft-80f0f247b64e

Chinese Zodiacs that can be minted (NFT) based on a user's birth date (example: https://ethsigns.com/index/earth/pig/). As this isn't my primary area and with my limited time I haven't gotten that far other than to create a simple Flask app that my original intention was to create a REST API for that could pull from a JavaScript front-end to interface with xDai. This would just be for fun to compare personality traits (Earth Pig : https://www.thechinesezodiac.org/astrology/zodiac-signs/pig/) and then could morph into something more later, such as a way to import for games that would tilt towards which Zodiacs get along (compatibility- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac)  for team formation (and/or different starting skills based on personality traits).
