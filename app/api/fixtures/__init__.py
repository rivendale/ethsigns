            "You are candid and fair and exude confidence wherever you go. You respect tradition, value honor, and enjoy helping people. Dogs are possibly the least materialistic of the signs, and are not driven by money, although they are adept at earning whatever they need. You will do everything in your power to help right the wrong. Faithful and honest, you have the most profound sense of duty. You can be relied upon to never let people down. You are happiest when you have a humanitarian purpose. Frank and honest, you prefer to get to the heart of the matter right away. And your quick tongue can sometimes be hurtful or sarcastic.",
            "And as a good listener and an expert adviser, your many close friends highly value your opinion.  You are anxious, terrified of rejection, and insecure about your own talents. You are an agreeable companion if you are in a good mood. At work you need a goal to motivate you, but in reality, it is not easy for you to set a lifetime goal. You are honorable and trustworthy, and expect those same traits from your friends. Intuitive and talented, you make a splendid captain of industry, a priest, an educator, a critic, or a doctor. You are usually very generous and loyal, and in love, you are honest and straightforward.",
            "Slow to make close friends, few people are judged worthy of entering into your close circle. You will be frank with you when you are wrong, and will be ready to fight for you when you are being wronged. Usually animated and attractive, you have a unique sense of humor. A pessimist at heart, a dog thinks the worst is yet to come and is constantly anxious and doubtful about her own ability. In business, you are amongst devoted bosses and will speak up without hesitation when you see faults. With your sensitive and compassionate heart, you will do well as charity workers, doctors, missionaries, or teachers."

            "The Pig is a wise but passive observer rather than an active participant throughout life. You are the type of person everyone admires most, and many friends consider you some of the nicest, most loving and caring people around. You are quite famous for your hospitality. “To love, to give, and to share” is probably the motto you’ve lived by. People can’t help but wonder if you really exist because you seem too good to be true. You are not impressed with wealth or status, and they’re extremely generous. You love to socialize and have no trouble making and keeping friends.",
            "You are quite self-indulgent when it comes to your own needs. You don't worry about spending money. You recoil from confrontations and have difficulty saying no. The rapidly acquiescing Pig forgives easily and takes blame unduly. You know how to have a good time and constantly seek pleasure. You are a caring friend, so if you invite someone into your circle, he or she will be in for a lifetime of loyal, faithful, and giving friendship. You are intelligent, erudite, and have a great thirst for knowledge. You are hardworking, optimistic and determined, which is probably why you usually succeed in your career. You care a great deal about your image and how others view you, which makes you more vulnerable and gullible. You love social events and knows how to enjoy yourself at a party. As a boss or manager, you are energetic and involved, and surprisingly, very approachable.",
            "You are everyone’s best friend and a supportive team member. You are completely devoted and will sacrifice your own welfare for others. Your love for food and luxury makes you excellent chefs or restaurant owners. You are romantic, affectionate, and monogamous once you commit to a relationship."
